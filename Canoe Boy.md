They have ceiling tiles like they had back at school
Back when we were uncool, we are still uncool
And I lay back and I thought of you,
Would it be uncool if I lost my cool?

And she leans across the isle and she asks if I'm alright
Well I am not but it is not something I'd admit tonight
The weary walk wounded never give up on a fight
But I am stuck here leaving early, bundled onto this flight

But you can't kill canoe boy
No you can't kill canoe boy
Yeah you can't kill canoe boy
What, you'd watch Netflix the rest of your lift?

Well lights gently flicker and machines often bleep
I've rehearsed this all before try to remedy my lack of sleep
But as I flirt with dreams my thoughts drift back to you
What could you even do, if I lost my cool?

Canoe boy ran off into the forest give him 5 minutes he'll be fine
Try to ignore red eyes its not like its a sign
Stretched torn sinew stomach twisted up inside
Word locked in lungs he would have rather drowned this time

But you can't kill canoe boy
You can't kill canoe boy
No you can't kill canoe boy
Take a deep breath it will be alright

But you can't kill canoe boy
You can't kill canoe boy
No you can't kill canoe boy
Take a step back it will be alright

And he sees canoe girl from across the pool
She's loosing her cool, we are so out of cool
And she sobs, what, are we supposed to do?
Is this the end, the end for me and you?

(And he) says you can't kill canoe girl
You can't kill canoe girl
No you can't kill canoe girl
Nah, she's stronger than her spine

Yeah you can't kill canoe girl
You can't kill canoe girl
No you can't kill canoe girl
Nah, she's too stubbornly alive
