It begins in a layby a little to far from a town
Under grey skies with rain, drop dripping down
Onto slightly soggy kit with little long enough to dry
These adventures aren't forever but while we've got the time

With weather warnings issued all along the western side
We packed our bags and downed our beers tried to get and early night
But it was useless, just lay they, thoughts running through my head
All caught up in the excitement and a growing sense of dread

But she had eyes, eyes like grey summer skies
And her hair was torn up by the wind
And she smiled as she said its nice to see that your not dead
And then her face broke out into a grin

And we kissed in a layby a little too far from a town
Under grey skies with rain, drops dripping down
Onto slightly soppy souls, lost in each others eyes
These adventures aren't forever but the might just last the night

But her mothers knives were blunt, as blunt as they could be
And her mothers eyes were scared, so scared that you could see
She said I just couldn't stand the thought that while chopping you could slip
Burry all these knives inside the lives you could have lived

But we still kissed in a layby a little too far from a town
Under grey skies with rain, drops dripping down
Onto slightly soppy souls, lost in each others eyes
These adventures aren't forever but the might just last the night
