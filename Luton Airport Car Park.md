I stood their stranded
In Luton airport car park
The day my car would not start
The day that I met you

Defibrillator car start
Help me escape
Luton Airport Carpark
No where's more depressing on a fine summers day

But the way that the weeds grow through cracks in concrete
There's still beauty to be found
Blackberries all along the fence line
Guarded in nettle shrouds

Oh I loved you like Luton Airport Car Park
How I love Luton Airport Car Park
Oh I loved you like Luton Airport Car Park
Darling, how I loved you

But it was some way short of a destination
It was never near to a home
I kept struggling to find the exit
You said I'd no where better to go

Oh I loved you like Luton Airport Car Park
Fucking hate Luton Airport Car Park
Oh I loved you like Luton Airport Car Park
Darling, I hate you

[Interlude]

Yeah I love you like Luton Airport Car Park
No one loves Luton Airport Car Park
Got to get through Luton Airport Car Park
To get where your headed all the same

Like a sunny stag do in Spain
