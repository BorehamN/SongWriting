Down by the river by the way by the shore
If I didn't know better would have said we'd been here before
Oh down by the river by the way by the shore
Lifted on a breath of the wind because she breathed to explore

And those stary nights
And those stary nights
And those stary nights
Will never be the same

I took my time on the Thames, then slipped through the crack of Dawn
I battled with the Bitches and traversed Tawe moors
Met my match on the Melte and got lost amongst the locks
I spent my nights swapping stories sipping whiskey till dawn

And those stary nights
And those stary nights
And those stary nights
Will never be the same

Pick me up swiftly let the wind carry me away
I was always please to see you man but I could never stay
And in the darkest nights won't you whisper me some words
Then rest softly knowing you were heard

And those stary nights
And those stary nights
And those stary nights
Are somehow brighter than before

Down by the river by the way by the shore
Down by the river by the way by the shore
Down by the river by the way by the shore
Lifted on a breath of the wind because she breathed to explore
