Be careful she said as we left
Those words stuck in my head
Be careful she said as we left
But had the lovers heard, would they have ever leapt?

Oh its funny how the best and worst quite often align
How we can go from one in the blink of an eye
She said that river is hungry it take a soul every year
Its a fact to well known to too many around here

But we were young and indestructible 
Our souls incorruptible
Blinded by our arrogance from
Lessons we were yet to learn
Yes we were young and indestructible 
Our souls incorruptible
Blinded by our arrogance from
Lessons we were yet to learn

[interlude]

With rivers running high and emotions in spate
Oh we should have heeded warning from the lovers fate
They say you'll never know life if you never know death
But its not an excuse to be that fucking reckless

And had the lovers known when the leapt from the leap
Into the boiling undercut cauldron beneath
Oh had the lovers know just what lay beneath
Would they ever have leapt, from lovers leap?

Oh did you see the lovers was it them who dragged you down
Oh did you see the lovers was it them who pulled you out
Oh did you see the lovers, oh did you see the lovers?
Oh did you see the lovers while you were down?

Were they young and indestructible 
Their souls incorruptible
Blinded by their arrogance from
Lessons they would never learn
Were they young and indestructible 
Their souls incorruptible
Blinded by their arrogance from
Lessons they would never learn

Oh did you see the lovers, oh did you see the lovers?
Oh did you see the lovers while you were down?
Oh did you see the lovers, oh did you see the lovers?
Oh did you see the lovers while you were down?
Oh did you see the lovers, oh did you see the lovers?
Oh did you see the lovers while you were down?

Be careful she said as we left
Those words stuck in my head
As I held your breath
