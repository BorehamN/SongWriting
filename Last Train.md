[Cadd9] Trekking through [Gadd9] tunnels and tubes
[Cadd9] Does this feel like [Gadd9] Christmas to you?
[Cadd9] I'm racing to catch the [Em] last [Gadd9] train out of [D] London

[Cadd9] And this 2am [Gadd9] train contains
[Cadd9] Pissheads hangovers [Gadd9] hung in shame
[Cadd9] Last Survivors of [Em] this [Gadd9] years office [D] parties

[Cadd9] And I couldn't afford the [Gadd9] 5 pound pints
[Cadd9] Picked cups of coffee [Gadd9] 'cause I'm scared I might
[Cadd9] Miss my stop on the [Em] last [Gadd9] train out of [D] London
[Cadd9] No I daren't catch sleep on the [Em] last [Gadd9] train out of [D] London

[C] Oh I so rarely [G] get to see [Em] you [D] anymore
[C] Its the feeling, [G] hits me, stumbling [Em] past out [D] old front door
[C] And so much has [G] changed since those [Em] times when we were [D] young
[Cadd9] When we'd walk home [Em] together [Cadd9] as the sun rose [D]
[Cadd9] When we'd walk home [Em] together [Cadd9] as the sun rose [D]

[Cadd9] And all the tacky ornaments [Gadd9] are fine
[Cadd9] And all the songs are filled [Gadd9] with forced rhymes
[Cadd9] But I have to say that [Em] I [Gadd9] hate Christmas in [D] London
[Cadd9] No I really have [Em] no [Gadd9] love lost for [D] London

[Em] That black hole [G] city always [C] could drag me [D] down
[Em] You say its ironic [G] its the [C] last place you thought I'd [D] drown
[C] But I miss out hearts to [G] hearts on the [D] fountain and river [Em] side
[Cadd9] But I guess the sun has set [Em] on [Cadd9] our sunrise [D]
[Cadd9] Yes I guess the sun has set [Em] on [Cadd9] our sunrise [D]

[Cadd9] Oh but once a year when the [Gadd9] days grow short
[Cadd9] I'll pack my bags [Gadd9] we'll all meet up
[Cadd9] Grab dinner or [Em] something [Cadd9] down in [D] London

[Cadd9] Hairs are receding and [Gadd9] going grey
[Cadd9] You ask what's changed, its [Gadd9] mostly the same
[Cadd9] Just old friends chatting [Em] bullshit [Gadd9] down in [D] London

[Cadd9] No I really don't mind the [Em] last [Gadd9] train out of [D] London
[Cadd9] Oh for you I'd miss the [Em] last [Gadd9] train out of [D] London
[Cadd9] I hope the snow delays the [Em] last [Gadd9] train out of [D] London
