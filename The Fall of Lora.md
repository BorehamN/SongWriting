falls of lora song

```song

[C] I swore I'd never love again, [Em] following your scorn
[G] But Bankart's lesions ley defeated in [D] November's dawn
[C] So in response to quests from [Em] country men who ask where I have [G] gone
I have gone, I have [D] gone, I have gone!
 
[C] Ooh, [Em] ooh, [G] oohoo[D]hooh
[C] Ooh, [Em] ooh, [G] oohoo[D]hooh

[C] Did you listen to the tales of [Em] losses and defeats?
[G] Did the sights of slings and bandages become [D] synonymous with me?
[C] But such a viscous reputation [Em] never did belong
Now he is [G] gone, he is gone, [D] he is gone

[Em] But you can find me [G] at the [C] Falls of [G] Lora
[C] Lora let your [G] summer spring tide [D] turn
[Em] Yes, you can find me [G] at the [C] Falls of [G] Lora
[C] Lora I'm awai[G]ting your [D] return

[C] Ooh, [Em] ooh, [G] oohoo[D]hooh
[C] Ooh, [Em] ooh, [G] oohoo[D]hooh

[C] But darling, [G] darling, yes you're [D] gonna get [Em] hurt
[C] Yes darling, [G] darling, I guess the [D] lessons not [Em] learnt
[C] And darling, and [G] darling, and [D] darling, and [Em] darling.
[C] Darling, [G] darling, [D] ooh

[Em] Well you can find me [G] at the [C] Falls of [G] Lora
[C] Lora let your [G] summer spring tide [D] turn
[Em] Yes, you can find me [G] at the [C] Falls of [G] Lora
[C] Lora I'm awai[G]ting your [D] return

[C] Ooh, [Em] ooh, [G] oohoo[D]hooh

[C] And I would be remised to say that I [Em] never fell out of love
[G] And it has taken years of hard work to [D] rebuild this trust
[C] Oh but Lora's love withered but it [Em] never truly died
[G] Now I'm alive, I'm alive, [D] I'm alive

[Em] And you can find me [G] at the [C] Falls of [G] Lora
[C] Lora let your [G] summer spring tide [D] turn
[Em] Yes, you can find me [G] at the [C] Falls of [G] Lora
[C] Lora I'm awai[G]ting your [D] return

[C] Ooh, [Em] ooh, [G] oohoo[D]hooh
